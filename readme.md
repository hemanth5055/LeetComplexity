1. Navigate to any LeetCode problem (e.g., `https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/`)
2. Write or paste your solution in the code editor
3. **Important:** Scroll the code editor to the top before clicking the analyze button
4. Look for the **graph/curve button** in the top control bar
5. Click the button to start analyzing your code
